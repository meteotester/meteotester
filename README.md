meteotester
===========

MeteoTester is a project developed to aggregate and analyse weather information coming from multiple datasources, by storing, processing and comparing forecasts and observations.
For the moment, it consumes data from [forecast.io][forecastio], [openweathermap.org][openweather] and [wunderground.com][wunderground] APIs.
It uses [Amazon S3 Web Service][s3] as storage.


Goals
-------------------

MeteoTester starts on August 2013. It is intended to collect and test forecasts published by any meteorological data source. Â¿Why?

    To compare weather information from different providers.
    To find the most reliable weather forecasts.
    To report current limitations of predictions in terms of accuracy.
    To establish a public transparent benchmark for weather forecast verification.
    To improve weather forecasts.
